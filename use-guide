(Installation)
--------------

The install files can be downloaded from retropie.com
Unzip the downloaded package.
Flash the package to a microSD card (8GB or higher) using a Linux computer.
Plug in SD card to bottom of device. 
Plug in HDMI monitor.

Connect device to internet using Wifi or Ethernet using the retropie wifi connector in the menu.
Navigate to the Retropie settings page and install the retropie packages.
Load some games and enjoy the system!


(Power and Shutdown)
--------------------
NEVER unplug until successfully powered off. (This has a chance of destroying the SD card.)
Always safely shutdown from the main screen. Data loss can happen if not done correctly.

The device requires a 2.4A, 5V (Amp, Volt) output. 
Less voltage and amperage will result in data loss, and possibly ruin the system. 


(Loading Games)
---------------

On a blank flash drive, make a folder labeled 'retropie'. 
Insert it into the device and wait for 30 seconds. 
Inside the 'retropie' folder there will now be subfolders, including ROMs and BIOS.
The necessary BIOS files go in the BIOS folder. 
Place ROM files in their respective subfolder in the ROMs folder and save.

Plug the flash drive back into the device, and wait another 30 seconds. 
The device will now auto load those files from the flash drive into its memory.
Restart the device, and it will include the new games and files in its storage.

* Make SURE that when you load a game, the appropriate BIOS for that game is in the BIOS file.
  If it's not, the game will not retain ANY save data after resetting.
